# Dreamine.PLC.Omron.CxComponent

This package provides an Omron CX-Component adapter boundary for the Dreamine PLC communication stack.

- Core provides shared runtime infrastructure.
- Vendor adapters implement device-specific communication.
- WPF provides monitoring and diagnostic UI components.

## Features

- Omron CX-Component adapter boundary
- Vendor-specific connection option model
- Dreamine.PLC.Core integration point
- PLC read/write operation adapter structure
- Isolation of vendor dependency from application layers
